## ‚ö° Step 6: Verify It Worked (30 seconds)

### Check 1: Database
Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT title, status, audio_duration_seconds, compiled_audio_url
FROM publications
WHERE platform = 'spotify'
ORDER BY requested_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result**:
- `title`: "Spotify Test Story"
- `status`: "published"
- `audio_duration_seconds`: ~30-60 (depending on story length)
- `compiled_audio_url`: Full URL to MP3 file

### Check 2: Audio File
1. Copy `compiled_audio_url` from database
2. Open URL in browser
3. Should download/play MP3 audiobook (cover + all scenes concatenated)

### Check 3: RSS Feed
1. Open: http://localhost:3001/api/podcast/feed.xml
2. Should see XML with your story in `<item>` tag:
   ```xml
   <item>
     <title>Spotify Test Story</title>
     <enclosure url="https://[...].mp3" ... />
   </item>
   ```

## ‚úÖ Success!

If all 3 checks pass:
- ‚úÖ Spotify publishing works locally
- ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Button stuck on "Publishing..."**
- Check browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console) for errors
- Check terminal logs where dev server is running
- Database should show `status = 'published'` or `'failed'` (not 'compiling')

**Error: "publications table does not exist"**
- Retry Step 1 (apply migration)
- Verify: `SELECT * FROM publications;` returns empty result (not error)

**Error: "Failed to upload to storage"**
- Verify `story-audio-files` bucket exists and is **public**
- Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí story-audio-files ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Public bucket ‚úì

**Error: "Please generate audio for all scenes"**
- All scenes must have audio (green audio players)
- Click "Generate Audio" for any missing scenes

**Button is gray but disabled**
- Story might already be published
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM publications WHERE project_id = '[story-id]';`
- If exists, button correctly shows published state
