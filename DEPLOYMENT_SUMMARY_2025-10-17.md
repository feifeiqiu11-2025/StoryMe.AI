# Deployment Summary - October 17, 2025

## Critical Fix: Project Deletion Functionality

### Problem
Users were unable to delete projects, receiving error: "Failed to delete: Failed to delete project"

**Root Cause:** Database foreign key constraint on `generated_images.project_id` was missing `ON DELETE CASCADE`, preventing project deletion when images existed.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Database Migration (REQUIRED for Production)
**File:** `storyme-app/fix-cascade-delete.sql`

This SQL migration MUST be run on production database before deployment:

```sql
-- Drop existing constraint
ALTER TABLE generated_images
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS generated_images_project_id_fkey;

-- Add constraint with CASCADE DELETE
ALTER TABLE generated_images
  ADD CONSTRAINT generated_images_project_id_fkey
  FOREIGN KEY (project_id)
  REFERENCES projects(id)
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

**How to apply in production:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `storyme-app/fix-cascade-delete.sql`
3. Execute the SQL
4. Verify the constraint was added correctly (verification query included in file)

#### 2. Code Changes

**Enhanced Logging & Error Handling:**
- `storyme-app/src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts` - Added detailed server-side logging
- `storyme-app/src/app/(dashboard)/projects/page.tsx` - Enhanced client-side error handling

These changes improve debugging and provide better error messages to users.

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment (Critical)
- [ ] **Run database migration** `fix-cascade-delete.sql` on production Supabase
- [ ] Verify migration succeeded using the verification query
- [ ] Backup database before migration (optional but recommended)

### Code Deployment
- [ ] Commit all changes to git
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (will auto-deploy from main branch)
- [ ] Verify deployment succeeded

### Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Test project deletion with projects that have images
- [ ] Test project deletion with projects that have no images
- [ ] Verify deleted projects are fully removed from database
- [ ] Verify associated images are deleted from Supabase Storage
- [ ] Test guest mode sign-in flow
- [ ] Test character image upload and preview

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert database migration:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE generated_images DROP CONSTRAINT generated_images_project_id_fkey;
   ALTER TABLE generated_images
     ADD CONSTRAINT generated_images_project_id_fkey
     FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id);
   ```
2. Revert code deployment via Vercel dashboard

## Testing Results

### Local Testing âœ…
- Project deletion now returns HTTP 200 (success)
- Server logs confirm successful deletion flow
- UI properly removes deleted projects from list
- No foreign key constraint violations

### Production Testing Needed
- [ ] Verify cascade delete works on production database
- [ ] Confirm Supabase Storage cleanup works
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users

## Impact Assessment

**Risk Level:** Medium
- Database schema change required
- Migration is non-destructive (only changes constraint behavior)
- Code changes are additive (enhanced logging/error handling)

**User Impact:** High positive impact
- Fixes critical functionality (project deletion)
- Improves error visibility for debugging
- Better user experience with clearer error messages

**Downtime Required:** None
- Migration can be applied while app is running
- Code deployment is zero-downtime

## Notes

- The logging added to DELETE route can be removed after confirming production works
- Consider adding monitoring/alerts for failed delete operations
- Future enhancement: Add soft delete instead of hard delete for data recovery
