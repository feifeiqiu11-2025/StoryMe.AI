## 🐛 Known Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Mock Return Values
**Issue**: Some mocks return hardcoded test values instead of dynamic values
**Impact**: NONE - Tests verify logic, not mock accuracy
**Status**: Can be improved but not required for production

### 2. File Size Mocking
**Issue**: Mock File constructor doesn't create actual blob size
**Impact**: NONE - Real browser File objects work correctly
**Status**: Test logic is verified, mock limitation only

### 3. Async Test Timing
**Issue**: Some async operations might need waitFor() helpers
**Impact**: MINIMAL - Tests pass, could be more robust
**Status**: Can be improved in future iterations
