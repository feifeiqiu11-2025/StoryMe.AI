No changes needed — still perfectly relevant.

---

#### **Card 2: Made to Make Reading Fun**
**Current:**
```
🎓 Made to Make Reading Fun

Kids are most motivated to read when the story feels like their own.
StoryMe adapts every story to your child's age and reading level —

**Current:**

brings it all to life. Our AI turns every idea, drawing, and doodle into
a polished, illustrated storybook.

for family and friends.
```

**Change:** Keep as is — still relevant.

---

#### **Card 6: Coming Soon: Co-Author Mode** → **REPLACE WITH NEW CARD**
**Current:**
```
✨ Coming Soon: Co-Author Mode

Imagine your child as a sidekick in their favorite Dog Man or Frozen
adventure — reading along as both fan and co-author. StoryMe is building
new ways to blend your child into beloved story worlds while keeping the
magic personal, safe, and educational.
```

**Proposed:**
```
🎧 Stories That Follow Your Child Everywhere

Create once in KindleWood Studio, then publish to our mobile reading app
and Spotify. Your child's personalized stories become interactive learning
tools they can read at bedtime, listen to in the car, or explore with
AI-powered word help — wherever they learn best.

(Coming Soon: KindleWood Kids app and Spotify publishing)
```

**Reasoning:** Replace "co-author mode" (which is further out on roadmap) with the immediate ecosystem vision that differentiates KindleWood.

---

### 8. **How It Works - Section Updates**

**Keep Steps 1-5 with minor brand name updates:**

#### Step 1: Create Your Characters (KEEP AS IS)
```
👦👧 Create Your Characters

Upload a photo or describe your child and family members. KindleWood keeps
their look consistent across every page and every book.
```

#### Step 2: Tell the Story (KEEP AS IS)
```
🎤 Tell the Story

Record your child's voice, upload a short video, snap a picture of their
drawing, or type a quick story idea. Our AI understands their imagination —
even if it starts with just a few doodles or sentences.
```

#### Step 3: Watch the Magic Happen (KEEP AS IS)
```
🎨 Watch the Magic Happen

KindleWood brings each story to life with beautiful, age-appropriate
illustrations that capture your child's world and emotions.
```

#### Step 4: Read, Print & Treasure
**Current:**
```
📖 Read, Print & Treasure

Download your finished storybook as a high-quality PDF — perfect for
bedtime reading, printing as a keepsake, or gifting to grandparents.
```

**Proposed:**
```
📖 Review, Edit & Perfect

Preview your storybook, make edits, and regenerate any pages until it's
perfect. Then download as a high-quality PDF — ready for bedtime reading,
printing as a keepsake, or gifting to grandparents.
```

**Reasoning:** More accurately describes the review/edit step that happens before download.

---

#### Step 5: Share and Grow Together
**Current:**
```
💬 Share and Grow Together

Share your child's story with family and friends, or with the StoryMe
community (coming soon). Tell us how we're doing — your feedback helps us
make the experience even more magical for every family.
```

**Proposed - REPLACE WITH NEW STEP 5:**
```
📱 Publish to Your Child's Reading App

Send your finished stories to KindleWood Kids — our mobile app where your
child can read with interactive features, earn reading badges, and learn
with AI-powered pronunciation help. (Coming Q1 2026)
```

---

#### **NEW STEP 6: ADD THIS**
```
🎧 Listen Anywhere on Spotify

Want your child to enjoy their story in the car or at bedtime without
screens? Publish to your family's private Spotify podcast and say:
"Alexa, play Emma's Dragon Adventure." Share episodes with grandparents
anywhere in the world. (Coming Q2 2026)
```

**Reasoning:** Completes the ecosystem story — Create → Publish → Read → Listen.

---

### 9. **Social Proof / Stats Section**
**Current:**
```
🎨 AI-Powered - Professional Illustrations
⚡ 5 Minutes - From Story to Book
💝 Forever - Cherished Keepsakes
```

**Proposed:**
```
🎨 AI-Powered - Professional Illustrations
⚡ 5 Minutes - From Story to Book
🌍 Everywhere - App, Print & Spotify
```

**Reasoning:** Replace "Forever/Cherished Keepsakes" with "Everywhere" to emphasize omnichannel distribution (key differentiator).

---

### 10. **Final CTA Section**
**Current:**
```
✨📖✨

Every child has a story worth telling — and reading.

Let StoryMe help you capture their imagination, nurture their love for
reading, and create memories you'll cherish for a lifetime.

## Questions for You

Before I implement these changes, please confirm:

1. **Branding:** Are you 100% committed to "KindleWood Studio" vs just "KindleWood"?
2. **Timing:** Are Q1 2026 (Kids app) and Q2 2026 (Spotify) realistic dates to show publicly?
3. **Spotify Details:** Should we mention "private family podcast" or keep it simpler?
4. **Benefit Card 6:** Replace "Co-Author Mode" with ecosystem card, or keep Co-Author as a longer-term vision?
5. **CTA Language:** "Start Creating Free for 7 Days" vs "Sign up for free 7 days trial"?
