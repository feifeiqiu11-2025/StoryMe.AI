```
Your Child IS the Story

Upload a photo once, and your child becomes the hero of every adventure.

Record their voice, upload a video, snap a photo of their crayon drawing,

ideas become professional storybooks with beautiful illustrations, perfect
grammar, and age-appropriate vocabulary. No design skills needed.

Stories you create in KindleWood Studio sync to the KindleWood Kids mobile

comprehension quizzes. Learning feels like playing, not studying — because
they're reading stories about themselves.
