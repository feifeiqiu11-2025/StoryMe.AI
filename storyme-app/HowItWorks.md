## 🔮 How It Works

**Tagline:** Creating a KindleWood book is simple, fun, and magical — for both you and your child.

### Step 1: Create Your Characters 👦👧

Upload a photo or describe your child and family members. KindleWood keeps their look consistent across every page and every book.

### Step 2: Tell the Story 🎤

Record your child's voice, upload a short video, snap a picture of their drawing, or type a quick story idea. Our AI understands their imagination — even if it starts with just a few doodles or sentences.

### Step 3: Watch the Magic Happen 🎨

KindleWood brings each story to life with beautiful, age-appropriate illustrations that capture your child's world and emotions.

### Step 4: Review, Edit & Perfect 📖

Preview your storybook, make edits, and regenerate any pages until it's perfect. Then download as a high-quality PDF — ready for bedtime reading, printing as a keepsake, or gifting to grandparents.

### Step 5: Publish & Share Everywhere 🌍

Publish to the [KindleWood Kids](https://kindle-wood-kids.vercel.app/) app for interactive reading. Send to Spotify for car rides and bedtime. Share with family and friends. Your stories follow your child everywhere they learn. (Coming soon)
