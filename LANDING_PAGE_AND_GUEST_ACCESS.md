## 3. Guest Access System

### Overview
Allows users to explore full functionality without creating an account. Only requires signup when ready to download PDF.

### Database Schema

#### New Tables Created

**`guest_sessions`**
- Tracks anonymous visitors via cookie-stored session tokens
- Captures: IP, user agent, referrer, landing page
- Optional geo data: country, region, city
- Session timing and duration

**`page_views`**
- Tracks navigation for both guests and registered users
- Links to either `user_id` OR `guest_session_id`
- Records: page path, title, referrer, view duration
- Indexed for analytics queries

**`events`**
- Tracks specific actions (character_created, story_generated, pdf_attempted)
- Categorized by type (engagement, conversion, error)
- Flexible JSON properties for event data
- Links to user or guest session

**Schema Modifications:**
- `projects` table: Now allows `guest_session_id` instead of requiring `user_id`
- `character_library` table: Now allows `guest_session_id` for temporary guest characters

### Analytics Views

**`daily_active_users`**
- Tracks registered vs. guest users by day
- Shows total unique users

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Session Token Generation
```typescript
// Generate anonymous session token
const sessionToken = crypto.randomUUID();

// Store in HTTP-only cookie
cookies().set('guest_session', sessionToken, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'lax',
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30, // 30 days
});
```

### Guest Session Creation
```typescript
// On first visit, create guest session
const { data: session } = await supabase
  .from('guest_sessions')
  .insert({
    session_token: sessionToken,
    ip_address: req.ip,
    user_agent: req.headers['user-agent'],
    referrer: req.headers['referer'],
    landing_page: req.url,
  })
  .select()
  .single();
```

### Event Tracking
```typescript
// Track any user action
await supabase.from('events').insert({
  guest_session_id: guestSessionId,
  event_name: 'character_created',
  event_category: 'engagement',
  event_properties: {
    character_name: 'Connor',
    has_photo: true,
  },
  page_path: '/guest/characters/new',
});
```

### Conversion on Signup
```typescript
// When guest signs up, link session to user
await supabase
  .from('guest_sessions')
  .update({
    converted_to_user_id: userId,
    converted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
  .eq('session_token', sessionToken);

// Migrate guest characters to user
await supabase
  .from('character_library')
  .update({
    user_id: userId,
    guest_session_id: null,
  })
  .eq('guest_session_id', guestSessionId);

// Migrate guest projects to user
await supabase
  .from('projects')
  .update({
    user_id: userId,
    guest_session_id: null,
  })
  .eq('guest_session_id', guestSessionId);
```
