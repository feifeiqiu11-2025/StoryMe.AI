What Sparked StoryMe 🌟

```
What Sparked KindleWood 🌟
```

**Story Content:**
```
One evening, my 4-year-old came running to me, eyes sparkling with
excitement. He had just made up a wild story about how his friend got
eaten by a dragon 🐉 — and how he and his superhero squad saved the day! 🦸‍♂️

As he told me every detail with so much imagination and joy, I realized
these moments are priceless — little sparks of creativity worth keeping
forever.

Around the same time, he was just beginning to learn how to read, and I
noticed how much more excited he was to read his own stories. Seeing
himself as the hero made reading fun, personal, and meaningful.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✨ That moment, KindleWood was born — to help parents       │
│ capture their child's imagination and turn it into          │
│ personalized storybooks that inspire a love for reading and │
│ create memories to cherish forever.                          │
