# StoryMe Project - Comprehensive Status & Roadmap
**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Current Phase**: POC/MVP Development
**Status**: Character Management ‚úÖ | Story Creation üöß | Image Generation ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

## üìã Executive Summary

StoryMe is an AI-powered personalized children's storybook creator. The application allows parents to:
1. Create character profiles of their children with photos and descriptions
2. Write or narrate story ideas
3. Generate consistent AI illustrations featuring their children
4. Export as PDF storybooks or animated videos

**Current State**: Character library is fully functional with database integration. Story creation flow is partially complete. Image generation endpoint exists but needs integration.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work (Phase 0 - Foundation)

### 1. Database Architecture ‚úÖ
- **Schema**: Complete PostgreSQL schema with all tables defined
  - `users` - User accounts and profiles
  - `character_library` - Reusable character profiles
  - `projects` - Story sessions
  - `scenes` - Individual story scenes
  - `generated_images` - AI-generated images with metadata
  - `character_ratings` - Consistency tracking
  - `storybooks` - Finalized products
  - Supporting tables: `project_characters`, `subscriptions`, `usage_logs`
- **Integration**: Supabase configured and working
- **File**: `database-schema.sql` with triggers and views

### 2. Authentication System ‚úÖ
- **Signup Flow**: Creates both `auth.users` and custom `users` table records
- **Login Flow**: Ensures user record exists (fixes existing users)
- **Session Management**: Supabase Auth handles sessions
- **User Context**: Available across all authenticated pages
- **Files**:
  - `src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`

### 3. Character Library Management ‚úÖ
- **Full CRUD Operations**:
  - ‚úÖ Create characters with detailed descriptions
  - ‚úÖ Edit existing characters
  - ‚úÖ Delete characters
  - ‚úÖ View all characters in grid layout
- **Image Upload**:
  - ‚úÖ Drag-and-drop interface
  - ‚úÖ Live preview
  - ‚úÖ File upload to `/uploads` folder
  - ‚úÖ Image URL stored in database
- **Database Integration**:
  - ‚úÖ All operations persist to `character_library` table
  - ‚úÖ User-scoped queries (only see your own characters)
  - ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints working
- **Import/Export**:
  - ‚úÖ Import characters from library to stories
  - ‚úÖ Prevent duplicate imports
- **Files**:
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/characters/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/story/CharacterManager.tsx`

### 4. Story Creation Workflow (Partial) üöß
- **Step 1**: Character Selection ‚úÖ
  - Add characters inline
  - Import from library
  - Character cards with descriptions
- **Step 2**: Script Input ‚úÖ
  - Multi-line text input
  - Character mention detection
  - Scene counting (max 15)
  - Sample script loader
- **Step 3**: Scene Parsing ‚úÖ
  - "Generate Story Scenes" button
  - Parse script into scenes
  - Extract character mentions per scene
  - Preview parsed scenes
- **Step 4**: Image Generation ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT CONNECTED
  - Button exists but not wired up
  - `/api/generate-images` endpoint exists
  - Need to connect UI to backend
- **Files**:
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/create/page.tsx`
  - `src/components/story/ScriptInput.tsx`
  - `src/lib/scene-parser.ts`

### 5. Fixed Critical Bugs ‚úÖ
1. **TypeError: onCharactersChange is not a function**
   - Fixed prop name mismatches across components
2. **TypeError: cannot access property 'length', scene.characters is undefined**
   - Fixed to use `scene.characterNames` instead
3. **Foreign Key Constraint Violation**
   - Added user record creation in signup/login
   - Added `ensureUserExists()` safety net
4. **Missing "Generate Story" Button**
   - Added button and scene preview UI

### 6. Developer Experience Improvements ‚úÖ
- **Error Logging**: Console logs for debugging
- **Debug Endpoints**: `/api/debug/check-table`, `/api/debug/test-insert`
- **Better Error Messages**: Show actual database errors
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
