## Overview

The quiz feature allows stories to have comprehension questions attached to them. Each story can have multiple quiz questions with 4 multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D).

---

## Database Schema

### Table: `quiz_questions`

Stores quiz questions for each story/project.

```sql
CREATE TABLE quiz_questions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  question_order INTEGER NOT NULL,
  question TEXT NOT NULL,
  option_a TEXT NOT NULL,
  option_b TEXT NOT NULL,
  option_c TEXT NOT NULL,
  option_d TEXT NOT NULL,
  correct_answer CHAR(1) NOT NULL CHECK (correct_answer IN ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')),
  explanation TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Index for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX idx_quiz_questions_project_id ON quiz_questions(project_id);
```

**Column Details:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the quiz question
- `project_id`: Foreign key to the story/project
- `question_order`: Order of the question (1, 2, 3, etc.)

**Relevant columns for quiz:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE story_audio_pages
  ADD COLUMN quiz_question_id UUID REFERENCES quiz_questions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ADD COLUMN page_type VARCHAR CHECK (page_type IN ('cover', 'scene', 'quiz_transition', 'quiz_question')),
  ALTER COLUMN scene_id DROP NOT NULL;  -- scene_id is nullable for quiz pages
```

## Quiz Display Guidelines for Kids App

### 1. **Don't Show Correct Answers**
- Kids should figure out answers on their own
- Don't highlight correct answers in green
- Don't show checkmarks (âœ“) on correct options
- Don't show explanations until after kid submits their answer

### 2. **Display Quiz After Story**
- Show quiz as additional pages after the story ends
- Use a transition page: "Let's see if our little readers and listeners are paying attention!"
- Then show quiz questions one by one

### 3. **Audio Playback**
- Each quiz question page has its own audio narration
- Audio reads the question and all 4 options aloud
- Format: "Question 1: What did Connor celebrate?. A: Daddy's birthday. B: His own birthday. C: A friend's birthday. D: A holiday."

### 4. **Question Display Format**
```
Question 1 of 3

2. Kid clicks "Submit Answer"
3. Show if they got it right or wrong
4. Show the explanation
5. Button to go to next question

## Example Usage for Kids App

### Fetching Quiz for a Story

```typescript
// Fetch story with quiz
const response = await fetch(`https://kindlewood-studio.vercel.app/api/projects/${storyId}`);
const data = await response.json();

const story = data.project;
const quizQuestions = story.quiz_questions || [];

// Check if story has a quiz
if (quizQuestions.length > 0) {
  console.log(`Story has ${quizQuestions.length} quiz questions`);

  // Sort by question_order
  quizQuestions.sort((a, b) => a.question_order - b.question_order);

  // Display quiz after story
  showQuizSection(quizQuestions);
}
```

### Checking Kid's Answer

```typescript
function checkAnswer(question, selectedAnswer: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D') {
  const isCorrect = selectedAnswer === question.correct_answer;

  return {
    isCorrect,
    explanation: question.explanation,
    correctAnswer: question.correct_answer,
    selectedOption: question[`option_${selectedAnswer.toLowerCase()}`],
    correctOption: question[`option_${question.correct_answer.toLowerCase()}`]
  };
}
```

### Playing Quiz Audio

```typescript
// Fetch audio pages
const audioResponse = await fetch(`https://kindlewood-studio.vercel.app/api/projects/${storyId}/audio-pages`);
const audioData = await audioResponse.json();

// Filter quiz audio pages
const quizAudioPages = audioData.pages.filter(page =>
  page.page_type === 'quiz_transition' || page.page_type === 'quiz_question'
);

// Play transition audio first
const transitionAudio = quizAudioPages.find(p => p.page_type === 'quiz_transition');
if (transitionAudio) {
  playAudio(transitionAudio.audio_url);
}

// Then play each question's audio
for (const question of quizQuestions) {
  const questionAudio = quizAudioPages.find(p =>
    p.quiz_question_id === question.id
  );

  if (questionAudio) {
    playAudio(questionAudio.audio_url);
  }
}
```

## Data Validation

### Quiz Question Constraints
- âœ… Each story can have 0 or more quiz questions
- âœ… Questions are ordered by `question_order` (1, 2, 3, ...)
- âœ… Each question must have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- âœ… Correct answer must be one of: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'
- âœ… Explanation is optional but recommended

### Audio Page Constraints
- âœ… `page_type` can be: 'cover', 'scene', 'quiz_transition', 'quiz_question'
- âœ… Quiz pages have `scene_id = null` and `quiz_question_id = UUID` (for quiz_question type)
- âœ… Quiz transition has both `scene_id = null` and `quiz_question_id = null`

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_story_audio_pages_quiz_question_id
  ON story_audio_pages(quiz_question_id);
```

### 2. Make scene_id nullable
```sql
ALTER TABLE story_audio_pages
  ALTER COLUMN scene_id DROP NOT NULL;
```

### 3. Add quiz page types to CHECK constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE story_audio_pages
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS story_audio_pages_page_type_check;

ALTER TABLE story_audio_pages
  ADD CONSTRAINT story_audio_pages_page_type_check
  CHECK (page_type IN ('cover', 'scene', 'quiz_transition', 'quiz_question'));
```
