## 💭 Questions to Resolve

1. **Scene Rating Implementation**: Multi-criteria (3 separate ratings) or single overall rating?
2. **Rating UI Placement**: Rate immediately after generation or allow later?
3. **Low Rating Action**: Auto-suggest regeneration? Or just track?
4. **Rating Analytics**: Build admin dashboard to see patterns?
5. **Storage Migration Timeline**: Before or after rating feature?
6. **Video Generation Priority**: Wait until after Phase 2 or start planning?

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### User Feedback Integration
The request for overall scene rating shows that users need:
1. **Multiple evaluation criteria**:
   - Character consistency (already have)
   - Scene description match (NEW)
   - Overall expectation (NEW)
   - Quality rating (NEW)

2. **Actionable insights**:
   - Which scenes need regeneration?
   - Are prompts matching expectations?
   - How to improve future generations?

3. **Data for improvement**:
   - Track low-rated scenes
   - Identify prompt patterns
   - Improve AI model selection

### Technical Considerations
- **Database design**: Separate columns vs. JSONB for flexibility?
- **UI/UX**: Don't overwhelm users with too many ratings
- **Analytics**: Need dashboard to visualize rating trends
- **Regeneration**: Automated or user-initiated?

---
