## 🎯 Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Session):
1. **Deploy pending changes** ⏳
   ```bash
   git add storyme-app/src/app/guest/page.tsx storyme-app/src/app/api/auth/signout/route.ts
   git commit -m "Add Save/Download buttons for guest mode and fix signout"
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Wait 3-4 minutes for Vercel deployment
   - Test on production: https://story-me-ai.vercel.app

2. **Test Production Features** 🧪
   - Guest mode character upload
   - Guest mode Save Story button (should show signup prompt)
   - Guest mode Download PDF button (should show signup prompt)
   - Authenticated user logout (should work without 404)
   - Story generation end-to-end

3. **User Testing & Feedback** 👥
   - Share with alpha testers
   - Collect feedback on UX
   - Monitor for errors in Vercel logs

### Short-term (This Week):
1. **Fix ESLint/TypeScript Warnings** 📝
   - Currently ignored in build (eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true)
   - Should fix warnings for production quality

2. **Improve RLS Security** 🔒
   - Current: Using service role client for public API (bypasses RLS)
   - Better: Implement proper RLS policies

3. **Add Analytics Tracking** 📈
   - Track guest-to-signup conversions
   - Monitor story generation success rate

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Git Workflow (IMPORTANT):
1. **Always ask user for permission before pushing to GitHub**
2. Test changes locally first at http://localhost:3004
3. User confirms changes work
4. Then commit and push
5. Vercel auto-deploys (2-3 minutes)
