## Known Limitations (Expected)

### Authentication
- No email verification yet (would need Supabase email config)
- No password reset flow
- No "Remember me" option

### Character Library
- No search functionality yet
- No filter/sort options
- No tags or categories
- No bulk actions

### Storage
- Supabase Storage bucket needs manual setup
- File upload will fail until bucket is created
- Images won't display until bucket is public

### Projects
- "Projects" navigation link is placeholder
- "Start New Project" button doesn't work yet
- "Stories using this character" section is placeholder

---

## Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Sign up → Create 3 characters → View each → Edit one → Delete one
2. Mark a character as favorite → Verify star changes
3. Upload different image types (JPEG, PNG, WebP)

### Edge Cases
1. Try creating character with no descriptions
2. Try uploading 11MB file
3. Try uploading non-image file (PDF, DOC)
4. Leave name blank and submit
5. Cancel character creation midway
6. Cancel character edit after making changes

### Error Scenarios
1. Lose internet connection during creation
2. Sign out in another tab (should redirect to login)
3. Try to access `/characters/invalid-id`
4. Upload image while not authenticated

---

## Feedback Template

When reviewing, consider:

### Visual Design
- Does it look professional?
- Is the hierarchy clear?
- Are colors consistent with brand?
- Is spacing appropriate?

### User Flow
- Is navigation intuitive?
- Are there too many/too few steps?
- Is it clear what to do next?
- Are confirmations necessary?

### Functionality
- Does everything work as expected?
- Are errors handled gracefully?
- Is loading feedback adequate?
- Is the app responsive?

### Content
- Are labels clear?
- Are instructions sufficient?
- Are error messages helpful?
- Is terminology consistent?

---

## Next Steps After Review

Based on your feedback, we can:

1. **Refine UX**: Adjust layouts, colors, spacing, wording
2. **Add Features**: Search, filters, sorting, tags
3. **Improve Validation**: More specific error messages
4. **Enhance Upload**: Drag & drop, image cropping, multiple photos
5. **Build Projects**: Start building project management system
6. **Add Story Generation**: Integrate with Fal.ai for actual story creation

---

## Quick Start for Testing

```bash
# 1. Ensure dev server is running
# Visit: http://localhost:3002

# 2. Sign up for test account
# Email: test@example.com
# Password: Test1234

# 3. Create test characters
# Try different scenarios:
# - With photo
# - Without photo
# - Minimal description (just name + age)
# - Full description (all fields)

# 4. Test all CRUD operations
# - Create
# - Read (view detail)
# - Update (edit)
# - Delete

# 5. Test edge cases
# - Invalid file uploads
# - Empty forms
# - Very long text in fields
```

---

## Important Notes

### Before Full Testing
You'll need to set up Supabase to test file uploads:

1. Create Supabase project
2. Run database schema SQL
3. Create `character-images` storage bucket
4. Make bucket public
5. Update `.env.local` with credentials

### Without Supabase Setup
You can still test:
- ✅ Authentication UI (will fail to submit)
- ✅ All page layouts and navigation
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Character creation without photos
- ❌ File upload (will error)
- ❌ Data persistence (no database)
